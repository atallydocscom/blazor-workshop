/**
 * Initializes a blazorLocalStorage object on the window, providing methods to interact with localStorage.
 * This immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) creates a closure to encapsulate the blazorLocalStorage object.
 * 
 * The blazorLocalStorage object contains three methods:
 * 1. get: Retrieves and parses a value from localStorage
 * 2. set: Stringifies and stores a value in localStorage
 * 3. delete: Removes a key-value pair from localStorage
 * 
 * @returns {void} This function doesn't return a value; it modifies the global window object.
