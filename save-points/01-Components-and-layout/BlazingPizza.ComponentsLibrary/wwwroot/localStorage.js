 * 
 * @property {function} get - Retrieves a value from localStorage by key.
 * @param {string} key - The key to look up in localStorage.
 * @returns {any|null} The parsed value if the key exists, or null if it doesn't.
 * 
 * @property {function} set - Stores a value in localStorage.
 * @param {string} key - The key under which to store the value.
 * @param {any} value - The value to be stored. It will be stringified before storage.
 * @returns {void}
 * 
 * @property {function} delete - Removes a key-value pair from localStorage.
 * @param {string} key - The key to be removed from localStorage.
