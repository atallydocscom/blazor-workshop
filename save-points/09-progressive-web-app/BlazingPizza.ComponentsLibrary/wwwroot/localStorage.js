 *
 * @property {function} blazorLocalStorage.get - Retrieves a value from localStorage.
 * @param {string} key - The key of the item to retrieve from localStorage.
 * @returns {*|null} The parsed value if the key exists, or null if it doesn't.
 *
 * @property {function} blazorLocalStorage.set - Stores a value in localStorage.
 * @param {string} key - The key under which to store the value.
 * @param {*} value - The value to store. Will be stringified before storage.
